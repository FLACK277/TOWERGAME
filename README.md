## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### **Architecture & Design Patterns**
```java
// Core game architecture
├── Game Engine
│   ├── GameLoop (60 FPS rendering)
│   ├── StateManager (Menu, Game, Pause)
│   └── ResourceManager (Assets, Sounds)
├── Entity System
│   ├── Tower Classes (Inheritance hierarchy)
│   ├── Enemy Classes (Polymorphic behavior)
│   └── Projectile System (Physics simulation)
└── AI System
    ├── Pathfinding (A* algorithm)
    ├── Decision Trees (Enemy behavior)
    └── Difficulty Scaling (Adaptive algorithms)
```

### **Key Technical Features**
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Clean separation of concerns with modular components
- **Efficient Rendering**: Optimized graphics pipeline for smooth 60 FPS gameplay
- **Smart Memory Management**: Efficient object pooling for projectiles and effects
